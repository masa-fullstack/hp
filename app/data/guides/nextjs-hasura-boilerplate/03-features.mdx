description: "Boilerplate for building applications using Hasura and Next.js."
---

This boilerplate is built on top of [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) and [Hasura](https://hasura.io/). So, you get all the benefits and features that these two softwares provide. However, the following features are the most important ones:

1. **Automatic compilation and bundling** of Next.js which ensures optimized code during production builds.
2. **Pre-rendering of pages** at build time (SSG) or request time (SSR).
3. Support for **TypeScript**.
4. **File-system routing** which helps in adding new routes to your application.
5. Support for **optimized images** out of the box.
6. Instant **real-time** GraphQL APIs.
7. Built-in **authorization** and **authentication**.
