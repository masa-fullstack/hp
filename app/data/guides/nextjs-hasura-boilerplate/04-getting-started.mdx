[**Hasura Next.js Boilerplate**](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate) is a boilerplate for building applications using Hasura and Next.js. This boilerplate consists of the following:

1. [**Frontend**](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate/tree/master/frontend): Next.js application
2. [**Backend**](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate/tree/master/backend): Dockerized Hasura application

## Overview

This boilerplate is built using the following technologies:

1. [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
2. [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
3. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
4. [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
5. [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
6. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

It supports GraphQL Query, Mutation and Subscription out of the box.

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
3. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Packages

1. [**Frontend**](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate/tree/master/frontend): Next.js application

This application is the primary user-facing application. Once it’s up and running (see Development section), it’s available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

2. [**Backend**](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate/tree/master/backend): Dockerized Hasura application

[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) is an open source engine that connects to our databases & micro-services and auto-generates a production-ready GraphQL backend. It’s very easy to get Hasura up and running on our local system. All the migrations are set up in the [migrations](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-trello-clone/tree/master/packages/backend/migrations) directory.

## Installation

1. **Clone the application.**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate.git
```

2. **Run the bootstrap script by running the following command from the root of your project:**

```bash
cd nextjs-hasura-boilerplate && yarn bootstrap
```

3. **Create a Google OAuth Client from https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient and copy the credentials to `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` file inside the `frontend` directory.**

4. **Start Docker and run both the applications by running the following command from the root of your project:**

```bash
yarn dev
```

We need to start Docker and then run the above command. The Hasura console will be available at [http://localhost:8080/console](http://localhost:8080/console). The Hasura GraphQL endpoint will be up and running on [http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql](http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql). The Next.js application will be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
